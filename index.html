<h1>Two Rare Souls</h1>
<p>A time where at such a young age two rare souls were connected together at such a special, but different time. This was a time frame where both individuals had so much going on within their lives that the thought of them being together was more of a way to fill a void for the happiness they were both missing, but this connection placed them both  to provide each other with an experience that they wanted to love and enjoy forever. She was like the moon and he was like the sun shining light in each other’s lives at a point in time where they both sought out for it the most. She sought out for love because of the idea it brought, but she never imagined to find someone so real and raw, but then came a reconnection with him that allowed her to finally seek the experience she longed for. As everything started to become so real the two constantly kept being divided by the distractions of this world making their love come to a complicated end. This made it even more hard on her to forget, and let go since it was an experience that she never had, and it had come to this kind of end. She believed that they were two rare souls that found one another at such a young age. two rare souls that reconnected with each other but just at what seems like a time that might’ve been too soon based on the hardships that were going on in each other’s lives at the time. These were two rare souls that came back to each other, but suddenly separated but one day they’ll be two that’ll be guided back to one another and love each other as if they’re traveling to and from the moon.</p>
